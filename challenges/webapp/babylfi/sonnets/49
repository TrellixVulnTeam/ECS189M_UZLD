<h4>Sonnet XLIX</h4>

<p>Against that time, if ever that time come,<BR>
When I shall see thee frown on my defects,<BR>
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,<BR>
Call'd to that audit by advised respects;<BR>
Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass<BR>
And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,<BR>
When love, converted from the thing it was,<BR>
Shall reasons find of settled gravity,--<BR>
Against that time do I ensconce me here<BR>
Within the knowledge of mine own desert,<BR>
And this my hand against myself uprear,<BR>
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:<BR>
  To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,<BR>
  Since why to love I can allege no cause.<BR>
</p>
