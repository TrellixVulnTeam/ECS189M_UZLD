<h2>XXIX</h2>
<p class="poetry">I think of thee!&mdash;my thoughts do twine and
bud<br />
About thee, as wild vines, about a tree,<br />
Put out broad leaves, and soon there&rsquo;s nought to see<br />
Except the straggling green which hides the wood.<br />
Yet, O my palm-tree, be it understood<br />
I will not have my thoughts instead of thee<br />
Who art dearer, better!&nbsp; Rather, instantly<br />
Renew thy presence; as a strong tree should,<br />
Rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare,<br />
And let these bands of greenery which insphere thee,<br />
Drop heavily down,&mdash;burst, shattered everywhere!<br />
Because, in this deep joy to see and hear thee<br />
And breathe within thy shadow a new air,<br />
I do not think of thee&mdash;I am too near thee.</p>
