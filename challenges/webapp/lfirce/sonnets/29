<h4>XXIX</h4>
<p class="poetry">I think of thee!&mdash;my thoughts do twine and
bud
About thee, as wild vines, about a tree,
Put out broad leaves, and soon there&rsquo;s nought to see
Except the straggling green which hides the wood.
Yet, O my palm-tree, be it understood
I will not have my thoughts instead of thee
Who art dearer, better!&nbsp; Rather, instantly
Renew thy presence; as a strong tree should,
Rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare,
And let these bands of greenery which insphere thee,
Drop heavily down,&mdash;burst, shattered everywhere!
Because, in this deep joy to see and hear thee
And breathe within thy shadow a new air,
I do not think of thee&mdash;I am too near thee.</p>
