<p class="poetry">And wilt thou have me fashion into speech<br />
The love I bear thee, finding words enough,<br />
And hold the torch out, while the winds are rough,<br />
Between our faces, to cast light on each?&mdash;<br />
I drop it at thy feet.&nbsp; I cannot teach<br />
My hand to hold my spirits so far off<br />
From myself&mdash;me&mdash;that I should bring thee proof<br />
In words, of love hid in me out of reach.<br />
Nay, let the silence of my womanhood<br />
Commend my woman-love to thy belief,&mdash;<br />
Seeing that I stand unwon, however wooed,<br />
And rend the garment of my life, in brief,<br />
By a most dauntless, voiceless fortitude,<br />
Lest one touch of this heart convey its grief.</p>
