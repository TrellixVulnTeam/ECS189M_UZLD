<h4>XXV</h4>
<p class="poetry">A heavy heart, Belov&euml;d, have I borne<br/>
From year to year until I saw thy face,<br/>
And sorrow after sorrow took the place<br/>
Of all those natural joys as lightly worn<br/>
As the stringed pearls, each lifted in its turn<br/>
By a beating heart at dance-time.&nbsp; Hopes apace<br/>
Were changed to long despairs, till God&rsquo;s own grace<br/>
Could scarcely lift above the world forlorn<br/>
My heavy heart.&nbsp; Then thou didst bid me bring<br/>
And let it drop adown thy calmly great<br/>
Deep being!&nbsp; Fast it sinketh, as a thing<br/>
Which its own nature does precipitate,<br/>
While thine doth close above it, mediating<br/>
Betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate.</p>
