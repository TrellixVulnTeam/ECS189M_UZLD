<h4>XXV</h4>
<p class="poetry">A heavy heart, Belov&euml;d, have I borne
From year to year until I saw thy face,
And sorrow after sorrow took the place
Of all those natural joys as lightly worn
As the stringed pearls, each lifted in its turn
By a beating heart at dance-time.&nbsp; Hopes apace
Were changed to long despairs, till God&rsquo;s own grace
Could scarcely lift above the world forlorn
My heavy heart.&nbsp; Then thou didst bid me bring
And let it drop adown thy calmly great
Deep being!&nbsp; Fast it sinketh, as a thing
Which its own nature does precipitate,
While thine doth close above it, mediating
Betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate.</p>
