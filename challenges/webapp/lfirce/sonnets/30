<p class="poetry">I see thine image through my tears to-night,

And yet to-day I saw thee smiling.&nbsp; How
Refer the cause?&mdash;Belov&euml;d, is it thou
Or I, who makes me sad?&nbsp; The acolyte
Amid the chanted joy and thankful rite
May so fall flat, with pale insensate brow,
On the altar-stair.&nbsp; I hear thy voice and vow,
Perplexed, uncertain, since thou art out of sight,
As he, in his swooning ears, the choir&rsquo;s amen.
Belov&euml;d, dost thou love? or did I see all
The glory as I dreamed, and fainted when
Too vehement light dilated my ideal,
For my soul&rsquo;s eyes?&nbsp; Will that light come again,
As now these tears come&mdash;falling hot and real?</p>
