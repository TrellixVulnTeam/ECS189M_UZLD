<p class="poetry">I see thine image through my tears to-night,<br
/>
And yet to-day I saw thee smiling.&nbsp; How<br/>
Refer the cause?&mdash;Belov&euml;d, is it thou<br/>
Or I, who makes me sad?&nbsp; The acolyte<br/>
Amid the chanted joy and thankful rite<br/>
May so fall flat, with pale insensate brow,<br/>
On the altar-stair.&nbsp; I hear thy voice and vow,<br/>
Perplexed, uncertain, since thou art out of sight,<br/>
As he, in his swooning ears, the choir&rsquo;s amen.<br/>
Belov&euml;d, dost thou love? or did I see all<br/>
The glory as I dreamed, and fainted when<br/>
Too vehement light dilated my ideal,<br/>
For my soul&rsquo;s eyes?&nbsp; Will that light come again,<br/>
As now these tears come&mdash;falling hot and real?</p>
