<h2>III</h2>
<p class="poetry">Unlike are we, unlike, O princely Heart!<br />
Unlike our uses and our destinies.<br />
Our ministering two angels look surprise<br />
On one another, as they strike athwart<br />
Their wings in passing.&nbsp; Thou, bethink thee, art<br />
A guest for queens to social pageantries,<br />
With gages from a hundred brighter eyes<br />
Than tears even can make mine, to play thy part<br />
Of chief musician.&nbsp; What hast thou to do<br />
With looking from the lattice-lights at me,<br />
A poor, tired, wandering singer, singing through<br />
The dark, and leaning up a cypress tree?<br />
The chrism is on thine head,&mdash;on mine, the dew,&mdash;<br />
And Death must dig the level where these agree.</p>
