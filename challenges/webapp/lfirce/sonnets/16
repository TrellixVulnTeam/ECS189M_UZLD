<h4>XVI</h4>
<p class="poetry">And yet, because thou overcomest so,
Because thou art more noble and like a king,
Thou canst prevail against my fears and fling
Thy purple round me, till my heart shall grow
Too close against thine heart henceforth to know
How it shook when alone.&nbsp; Why, conquering
May prove as lordly and complete a thing
In lifting upward, as in crushing low!
And as a vanquished soldier yields his sword
To one who lifts him from the bloody earth,
Even so, Belov&euml;d, I at last record,
Here ends my strife.&nbsp; If thou invite me forth,
I rise above abasement at the word.
Make thy love larger to enlarge my worth!</p>
