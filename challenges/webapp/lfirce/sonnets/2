<h4>II</h4>
<p class="poetry">But only three in all God&rsquo;s universe<br
/>
Have heard this word thou hast said,&mdash;Himself, beside<br/>
Thee speaking, and me listening! and replied<br/>
One of us . . . that was God, . . . and laid the curse<br/>
So darkly on my eyelids, as to amerce<br/>
My sight from seeing thee,&mdash;that if I had died,<br/>
The death-weights, placed there, would have signified<br/>
Less absolute exclusion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay&rdquo; is worse<br/>
From God than from all others, O my friend!<br/>
Men could not part us with their worldly jars,<br/>
Nor the seas change us, nor the tempests bend;<br/>
Our hands would touch for all the mountain-bars:<br/>
And, heaven being rolled between us at the end,<br/>
We should but vow the faster for the stars.</p>
