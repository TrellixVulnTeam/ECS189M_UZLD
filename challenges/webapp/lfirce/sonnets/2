<h4>II</h4>
<p class="poetry">But only three in all God&rsquo;s universe
Have heard this word thou hast said,&mdash;Himself, beside
Thee speaking, and me listening! and replied
One of us . . . that was God, . . . and laid the curse
So darkly on my eyelids, as to amerce
My sight from seeing thee,&mdash;that if I had died,
The death-weights, placed there, would have signified
Less absolute exclusion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay&rdquo; is worse
From God than from all others, O my friend!
Men could not part us with their worldly jars,
Nor the seas change us, nor the tempests bend;
Our hands would touch for all the mountain-bars:
And, heaven being rolled between us at the end,
We should but vow the faster for the stars.</p>
