<p class="poetry">Oh, yes! they love through all this world of
ours!
I will not gainsay love, called love forsooth:
I have heard love talked in my early youth,
And since, not so long back but that the flowers
Then gathered, smell still.&nbsp; Mussulmans and Giaours
Throw kerchiefs at a smile, and have no ruth
For any weeping.&nbsp; Polypheme&rsquo;s white tooth
Slips on the nut if, after frequent showers,
The shell is over-smooth,&mdash;and not so much
Will turn the thing called love, aside to hate
Or else to oblivion.&nbsp; But thou art not such
A lover, my Belov&euml;d! thou canst wait
Through sorrow and sickness, to bring souls to touch,
And think it soon when others cry &ldquo;Too late.&rdquo;</p>
