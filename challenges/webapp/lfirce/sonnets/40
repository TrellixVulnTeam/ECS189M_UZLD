<p class="poetry">Oh, yes! they love through all this world of
ours!<br/>
I will not gainsay love, called love forsooth:<br/>
I have heard love talked in my early youth,<br/>
And since, not so long back but that the flowers<br/>
Then gathered, smell still.&nbsp; Mussulmans and Giaours<br/>
Throw kerchiefs at a smile, and have no ruth<br/>
For any weeping.&nbsp; Polypheme&rsquo;s white tooth<br/>
Slips on the nut if, after frequent showers,<br/>
The shell is over-smooth,&mdash;and not so much<br/>
Will turn the thing called love, aside to hate<br/>
Or else to oblivion.&nbsp; But thou art not such<br/>
A lover, my Belov&euml;d! thou canst wait<br/>
Through sorrow and sickness, to bring souls to touch,<br/>
And think it soon when others cry &ldquo;Too late.&rdquo;</p>
