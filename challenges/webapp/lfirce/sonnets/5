<p class="poetry">I lift my heavy heart up solemnly,<br />
As once Electra her sepulchral urn,<br />
And, looking in thine eyes, I over-turn<br />
The ashes at thy feet.&nbsp; Behold and see<br />
What a great heap of grief lay hid in me,<br />
And how the red wild sparkles dimly burn<br />
Through the ashen greyness.&nbsp; If thy foot in scorn<br />
Could tread them out to darkness utterly,<br />
It might be well perhaps.&nbsp; But if instead<br />
Thou wait beside me for the wind to blow<br />
The grey dust up, . . . those laurels on thine head,<br />
O my Belov&euml;d, will not shield thee so,<br />
That none of all the fires shall scorch and shred<br />
The hair beneath.&nbsp; Stand further off then! go!</p>
