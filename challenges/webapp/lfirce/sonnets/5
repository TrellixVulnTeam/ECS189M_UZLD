<h4>V</h4>
<p class="poetry">I lift my heavy heart up solemnly,
As once Electra her sepulchral urn,
And, looking in thine eyes, I over-turn
The ashes at thy feet.&nbsp; Behold and see
What a great heap of grief lay hid in me,
And how the red wild sparkles dimly burn
Through the ashen greyness.&nbsp; If thy foot in scorn
Could tread them out to darkness utterly,
It might be well perhaps.&nbsp; But if instead
Thou wait beside me for the wind to blow
The grey dust up, . . . those laurels on thine head,
O my Belov&euml;d, will not shield thee so,
That none of all the fires shall scorch and shred
The hair beneath.&nbsp; Stand further off then! go!</p>
