<h4>XI</h4>
<p class="poetry">And therefore if to love can be desert,<br />
I am not all unworthy.&nbsp; Cheeks as pale<br />
As these you see, and trembling knees that fail<br />
To bear the burden of a heavy heart,&mdash;<br />
This weary minstrel-life that once was girt<br />
To climb Aornus, and can scarce avail<br />
To pipe now &rsquo;gainst the valley nightingale<br />
A melancholy music,&mdash;why advert<br />
To these things?&nbsp; O Belov&euml;d, it is plain<br />
I am not of thy worth nor for thy place!<br />
And yet, because I love thee, I obtain<br />
From that same love this vindicating grace<br />
To live on still in love, and yet in vain,&mdash;<br />
To bless thee, yet renounce thee to thy face.</p>
