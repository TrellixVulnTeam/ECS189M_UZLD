<h4>XI</h4>
<p class="poetry">And therefore if to love can be desert,
I am not all unworthy.&nbsp; Cheeks as pale
As these you see, and trembling knees that fail
To bear the burden of a heavy heart,&mdash;
This weary minstrel-life that once was girt
To climb Aornus, and can scarce avail
To pipe now &rsquo;gainst the valley nightingale
A melancholy music,&mdash;why advert
To these things?&nbsp; O Belov&euml;d, it is plain
I am not of thy worth nor for thy place!
And yet, because I love thee, I obtain
From that same love this vindicating grace
To live on still in love, and yet in vain,&mdash;
To bless thee, yet renounce thee to thy face.</p>
