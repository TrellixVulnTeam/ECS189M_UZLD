<h2>XXXVII</h2>
<p class="poetry">Pardon, oh, pardon, that my soul should make<br
/>
Of all that strong divineness which I know<br />
For thine and thee, an image only so<br />
Formed of the sand, and fit to shift and break.<br />
It is that distant years which did not take<br />
Thy sovranty, recoiling with a blow,<br />
Have forced my swimming brain to undergo<br />
Their doubt and dread, and blindly to forsake<br />
Thy purity of likeness and distort<br />
Thy worthiest love to a worthless counterfeit.<br />
As if a shipwrecked Pagan, safe in port,<br />
His guardian sea-god to commemorate,<br />
Should set a sculptured porpoise, gills a-snort<br />
And vibrant tail, within the temple-gate.</p>
