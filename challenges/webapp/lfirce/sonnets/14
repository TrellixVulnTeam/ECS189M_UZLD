<p class="poetry">If thou must love me, let it be for nought

Except for love&rsquo;s sake only.&nbsp; Do not say
&ldquo;I love her for her smile&mdash;her look&mdash;her way

Of speaking gently,&mdash;for a trick of thought
That falls in well with mine, and certes brought
A sense of pleasant ease on such a day&rdquo;&mdash;
For these things in themselves, Belov&euml;d, may
Be changed, or change for thee,&mdash;and love, so wrought,
May be unwrought so.&nbsp; Neither love me for
Thine own dear pity&rsquo;s wiping my cheeks dry,&mdash;
A creature might forget to weep, who bore
Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby!
But love me for love&rsquo;s sake, that evermore
Thou may&rsquo;st love on, through love&rsquo;s eternity.</p>
