<p class="poetry">If thou must love me, let it be for nought<br
/>
Except for love&rsquo;s sake only.&nbsp; Do not say<br/>
&ldquo;I love her for her smile&mdash;her look&mdash;her way<br
/>
Of speaking gently,&mdash;for a trick of thought<br/>
That falls in well with mine, and certes brought<br/>
A sense of pleasant ease on such a day&rdquo;&mdash;<br/>
For these things in themselves, Belov&euml;d, may<br/>
Be changed, or change for thee,&mdash;and love, so wrought,<br/>
May be unwrought so.&nbsp; Neither love me for<br/>
Thine own dear pity&rsquo;s wiping my cheeks dry,&mdash;<br/>
A creature might forget to weep, who bore<br/>
Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby!<br/>
But love me for love&rsquo;s sake, that evermore<br/>
Thou may&rsquo;st love on, through love&rsquo;s eternity.</p>
