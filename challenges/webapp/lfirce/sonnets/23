<h4>XXIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">Is it indeed so?&nbsp; If I lay here dead,

Wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine?
And would the sun for thee more coldly shine
Because of grave-damps falling round my head?
I marvelled, my Belov&euml;d, when I read
Thy thought so in the letter.&nbsp; I am thine&mdash;
But . . . so much to thee?&nbsp; Can I pour thy wine
While my hands tremble?&nbsp; Then my soul, instead
Of dreams of death, resumes life&rsquo;s lower range.
Then, love me, Love! look on me&mdash;breathe on me!
As brighter ladies do not count it strange,
For love, to give up acres and degree,
I yield the grave for thy sake, and exchange
My near sweet view of heaven, for earth with thee!</p>
