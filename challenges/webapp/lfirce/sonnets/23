<h2>XXIII</h2>
<p class="poetry">Is it indeed so?&nbsp; If I lay here dead,<br
/>
Wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine?<br />
And would the sun for thee more coldly shine<br />
Because of grave-damps falling round my head?<br />
I marvelled, my Belov&euml;d, when I read<br />
Thy thought so in the letter.&nbsp; I am thine&mdash;<br />
But . . . so much to thee?&nbsp; Can I pour thy wine<br />
While my hands tremble?&nbsp; Then my soul, instead<br />
Of dreams of death, resumes life&rsquo;s lower range.<br />
Then, love me, Love! look on me&mdash;breathe on me!<br />
As brighter ladies do not count it strange,<br />
For love, to give up acres and degree,<br />
I yield the grave for thy sake, and exchange<br />
My near sweet view of heaven, for earth with thee!</p>
