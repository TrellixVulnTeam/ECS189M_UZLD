<h2>XLI</h2>
<p class="poetry">I thank all who have loved me in their
hearts,<br />
With thanks and love from mine.&nbsp; Deep thanks to all<br />
Who paused a little near the prison-wall<br />
To hear my music in its louder parts<br />
Ere they went onward, each one to the mart&rsquo;s<br />
Or temple&rsquo;s occupation, beyond call.<br />
But thou, who, in my voice&rsquo;s sink and fall<br />
When the sob took it, thy divinest Art&rsquo;s<br />
Own instrument didst drop down at thy foot<br />
To harken what I said between my tears, . . .<br />
Instruct me how to thank thee!&nbsp; Oh, to shoot<br />
My soul&rsquo;s full meaning into future years,<br />
That they should lend it utterance, and salute<br />
Love that endures, from life that disappears!</p>
