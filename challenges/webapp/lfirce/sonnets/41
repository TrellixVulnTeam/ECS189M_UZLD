<h4>XLI</h4>
<p class="poetry">I thank all who have loved me in their
hearts,
With thanks and love from mine.&nbsp; Deep thanks to all
Who paused a little near the prison-wall
To hear my music in its louder parts
Ere they went onward, each one to the mart&rsquo;s
Or temple&rsquo;s occupation, beyond call.
But thou, who, in my voice&rsquo;s sink and fall
When the sob took it, thy divinest Art&rsquo;s
Own instrument didst drop down at thy foot
To harken what I said between my tears, . . .
Instruct me how to thank thee!&nbsp; Oh, to shoot
My soul&rsquo;s full meaning into future years,
That they should lend it utterance, and salute
Love that endures, from life that disappears!</p>
