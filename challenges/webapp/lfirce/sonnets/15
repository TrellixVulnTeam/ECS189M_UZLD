<h4>XV</h4>
<p class="poetry">Accuse me not, beseech thee, that I wear
Too calm and sad a face in front of thine;
For we two look two ways, and cannot shine
With the same sunlight on our brow and hair.
On me thou lookest with no doubting care,
As on a bee shut in a crystalline;
Since sorrow hath shut me safe in love&rsquo;s divine,
And to spread wing and fly in the outer air
Were most impossible failure, if I strove
To fail so.&nbsp; But I look on thee&mdash;on thee&mdash;
Beholding, besides love, the end of love,
Hearing oblivion beyond memory;
As one who sits and gazes from above,
Over the rivers to the bitter sea.</p>
