<p class="poetry">Accuse me not, beseech thee, that I wear<br />
Too calm and sad a face in front of thine;<br />
For we two look two ways, and cannot shine<br />
With the same sunlight on our brow and hair.<br />
On me thou lookest with no doubting care,<br />
As on a bee shut in a crystalline;<br />
Since sorrow hath shut me safe in love&rsquo;s divine,<br />
And to spread wing and fly in the outer air<br />
Were most impossible failure, if I strove<br />
To fail so.&nbsp; But I look on thee&mdash;on thee&mdash;<br />
Beholding, besides love, the end of love,<br />
Hearing oblivion beyond memory;<br />
As one who sits and gazes from above,<br />
Over the rivers to the bitter sea.</p>
