<h2>XLIII</h2>
<p class="poetry">How do I love thee?&nbsp; Let me count the
ways.<br />
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height<br />
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight<br />
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.<br />
I love thee to the level of everyday&rsquo;s<br />
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.<br />
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;<br />
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.<br />
I love thee with the passion put to use<br />
In my old griefs, and with my childhood&rsquo;s faith.<br />
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose<br />
With my lost saints,&mdash;I love thee with the breath,<br />
Smiles, tears, of all my life!&mdash;and, if God choose,<br />
I shall but love thee better after death.</p>
