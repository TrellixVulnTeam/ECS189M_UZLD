<h4>XLIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">How do I love thee?&nbsp; Let me count the
ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of everyday&rsquo;s
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood&rsquo;s faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,&mdash;I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!&mdash;and, if God choose,
I shall but love thee better after death.</p>
