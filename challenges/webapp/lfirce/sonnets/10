<p class="poetry">Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed
And worthy of acceptation.&nbsp; Fire is bright,
Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light
Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed:
And love is fire.&nbsp; And when I say at need
I love thee . . . mark! . . . I love thee&mdash;in thy sight

I stand transfigured, glorified aright,
With conscience of the new rays that proceed
Out of my face toward thine.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing low

In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures
Who love God, God accepts while loving so.
And what I feel, across the inferior features
Of what I am, doth flash itself, and show
How that great work of Love enhances Nature&rsquo;s.</p>
