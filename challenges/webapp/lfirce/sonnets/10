<p class="poetry">Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed<br/>
And worthy of acceptation.&nbsp; Fire is bright,<br/>
Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light<br/>
Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed:<br/>
And love is fire.&nbsp; And when I say at need<br/>
I love thee . . . mark! . . . I love thee&mdash;in thy sight<br
/>
I stand transfigured, glorified aright,<br/>
With conscience of the new rays that proceed<br/>
Out of my face toward thine.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing low<br
/>
In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures<br/>
Who love God, God accepts while loving so.<br/>
And what I feel, across the inferior features<br/>
Of what I am, doth flash itself, and show<br/>
How that great work of Love enhances Nature&rsquo;s.</p>
