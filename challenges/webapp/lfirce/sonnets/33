<p class="poetry">Yes, call me by my pet-name! let me hear<br />
The name I used to run at, when a child,<br />
From innocent play, and leave the cowslips plied,<br />
To glance up in some face that proved me dear<br />
With the look of its eyes.&nbsp; I miss the clear<br />
Fond voices which, being drawn and reconciled<br />
Into the music of Heaven&rsquo;s undefiled,<br />
Call me no longer.&nbsp; Silence on the bier,<br />
While I call God&mdash;call God!&mdash;so let thy mouth<br />
Be heir to those who are now exanimate.<br />
Gather the north flowers to complete the south,<br />
And catch the early love up in the late.<br />
Yes, call me by that name,&mdash;and I, in truth,<br />
With the same heart, will answer and not wait.</p>
