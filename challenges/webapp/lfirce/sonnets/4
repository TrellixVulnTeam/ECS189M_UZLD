<h4>IV</h4>
<p class="poetry">Thou hast thy calling to some palace-floor,<br
/>
Most gracious singer of high poems! where<br />
The dancers will break footing, from the care<br />
Of watching up thy pregnant lips for more.<br />
And dost thou lift this house&rsquo;s latch too poor<br />
For hand of thine? and canst thou think and bear<br />
To let thy music drop here unaware<br />
In folds of golden fulness at my door?<br />
Look up and see the casement broken in,<br />
The bats and owlets builders in the roof!<br />
My cricket chirps against thy mandolin.<br />
Hush, call no echo up in further proof<br />
Of desolation! there&rsquo;s a voice within<br />
That weeps . . . as thou must sing . . . alone, aloof.</p>
