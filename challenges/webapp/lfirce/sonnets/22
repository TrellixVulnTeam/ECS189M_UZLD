<h2>XXII</h2>
<p class="poetry">When our two souls stand up erect and
strong,<br />
Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher,<br />
Until the lengthening wings break into fire<br />
At either curv&euml;d point,&mdash;what bitter wrong<br />
Can the earth do to us, that we should not long<br />
Be here contented?&nbsp; Think!&nbsp; In mounting higher,<br />
The angels would press on us and aspire<br />
To drop some golden orb of perfect song<br />
Into our deep, dear silence.&nbsp; Let us stay<br />
Rather on earth, Belov&euml;d,&mdash;where the unfit<br />
Contrarious moods of men recoil away<br />
And isolate pure spirits, and permit<br />
A place to stand and love in for a day,<br />
With darkness and the death-hour rounding it.</p>
