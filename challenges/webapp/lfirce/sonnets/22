<h4>XXII</h4>
<p class="poetry">When our two souls stand up erect and
strong,
Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher,
Until the lengthening wings break into fire
At either curv&euml;d point,&mdash;what bitter wrong
Can the earth do to us, that we should not long
Be here contented?&nbsp; Think!&nbsp; In mounting higher,
The angels would press on us and aspire
To drop some golden orb of perfect song
Into our deep, dear silence.&nbsp; Let us stay
Rather on earth, Belov&euml;d,&mdash;where the unfit
Contrarious moods of men recoil away
And isolate pure spirits, and permit
A place to stand and love in for a day,
With darkness and the death-hour rounding it.</p>
