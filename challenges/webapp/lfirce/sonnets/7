<h4>VII</h4>
<p class="poetry">The face of all the world is changed, I
think,<br />
Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul<br />
Move still, oh, still, beside me, as they stole<br />
Betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink<br />
Of obvious death, where I, who thought to sink,<br />
Was caught up into love, and taught the whole<br />
Of life in a new rhythm.&nbsp; The cup of dole<br />
God gave for baptism, I am fain to drink,<br />
And praise its sweetness, Sweet, with thee anear.<br />
The names of country, heaven, are changed away<br />
For where thou art or shalt be, there or here;<br />
And this . . . this lute and song . . . loved yesterday,<br />
(The singing angels know) are only dear<br />
Because thy name moves right in what they say.</p>
