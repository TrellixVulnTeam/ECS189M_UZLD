<p class="poetry">What can I give thee back, O liberal<br />
And princely giver, who hast brought the gold<br />
And purple of thine heart, unstained, untold,<br />
And laid them on the outside of the wall<br />
For such as I to take or leave withal,<br />
In unexpected largesse? am I cold,<br />
Ungrateful, that for these most manifold<br />
High gifts, I render nothing back at all?<br />
Not so; not cold,&mdash;but very poor instead.<br />
Ask God who knows.&nbsp; For frequent tears have run<br />
The colours from my life, and left so dead<br />
And pale a stuff, it were not fitly done<br />
To give the same as pillow to thy head.<br />
Go farther! let it serve to trample on.</p>
