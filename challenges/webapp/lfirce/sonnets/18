<h4>XVIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">I never gave a lock of hair away
To a man, Dearest, except this to thee,
Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully
I ring out to the full brown length and say
&ldquo;Take it.&rdquo;&nbsp; My day of youth went yesterday;

My hair no longer bounds to my foot&rsquo;s glee,
Nor plant I it from rose- or myrtle-tree,
As girls do, any more: it only may
Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears,
Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside
Through sorrow&rsquo;s trick.&nbsp; I thought the
funeral-shears
Would take this first, but Love is justified,&mdash;
Take it thou,&mdash;finding pure, from all those years,
The kiss my mother left here when she died.</p>
