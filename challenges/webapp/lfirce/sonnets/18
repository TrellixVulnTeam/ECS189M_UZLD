<h4>XVIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">I never gave a lock of hair away<br />
To a man, Dearest, except this to thee,<br />
Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully<br />
I ring out to the full brown length and say<br />
&ldquo;Take it.&rdquo;&nbsp; My day of youth went yesterday;<br
/>
My hair no longer bounds to my foot&rsquo;s glee,<br />
Nor plant I it from rose- or myrtle-tree,<br />
As girls do, any more: it only may<br />
Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears,<br />
Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside<br />
Through sorrow&rsquo;s trick.&nbsp; I thought the
funeral-shears<br />
Would take this first, but Love is justified,&mdash;<br />
Take it thou,&mdash;finding pure, from all those years,<br />
The kiss my mother left here when she died.</p>
