<h4>XXXVIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">First time he kissed me, he but only kissed

The fingers of this hand wherewith I write;
And ever since, it grew more clean and white.
Slow to world-greetings, quick with its &ldquo;O, list,&rdquo;

When the angels speak.&nbsp; A ring of amethyst
I could not wear here, plainer to my sight,
Than that first kiss.&nbsp; The second passed in height
The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed,
Half falling on the hair.&nbsp; O beyond meed!
That was the chrism of love, which love&rsquo;s own crown,
With sanctifying sweetness, did precede
The third upon my lips was folded down
In perfect, purple state; since when, indeed,
I have been proud and said, &ldquo;My love, my own.&rdquo;</p>
