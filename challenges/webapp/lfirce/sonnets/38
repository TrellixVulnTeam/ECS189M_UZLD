<h4>XXXVIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">First time he kissed me, he but only kissed<br
/>
The fingers of this hand wherewith I write;<br/>
And ever since, it grew more clean and white.<br/>
Slow to world-greetings, quick with its &ldquo;O, list,&rdquo;<br
/>
When the angels speak.&nbsp; A ring of amethyst<br/>
I could not wear here, plainer to my sight,<br/>
Than that first kiss.&nbsp; The second passed in height<br/>
The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed,<br/>
Half falling on the hair.&nbsp; O beyond meed!<br/>
That was the chrism of love, which love&rsquo;s own crown,<br/>
With sanctifying sweetness, did precede<br/>
The third upon my lips was folded down<br/>
In perfect, purple state; since when, indeed,<br/>
I have been proud and said, &ldquo;My love, my own.&rdquo;</p>
