<h4>VI</h4>
<p class="poetry">Go from me.&nbsp; Yet I feel that I shall
stand
Henceforward in thy shadow.&nbsp; Nevermore
Alone upon the threshold of my door
Of individual life, I shall command
The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand
Serenely in the sunshine as before,
Without the sense of that which I forbore&mdash;
Thy touch upon the palm.&nbsp; The widest land
Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine
With pulses that beat double.&nbsp; What I do
And what I dream include thee, as the wine
Must taste of its own grapes.&nbsp; And when I sue
God for myself, He hears that name of thine,
And sees within my eyes the tears of two.</p>
