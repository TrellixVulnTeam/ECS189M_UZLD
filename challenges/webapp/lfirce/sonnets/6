<h4>VI</h4>
<p class="poetry">Go from me.&nbsp; Yet I feel that I shall
stand<br/>
Henceforward in thy shadow.&nbsp; Nevermore<br/>
Alone upon the threshold of my door<br/>
Of individual life, I shall command<br/>
The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand<br/>
Serenely in the sunshine as before,<br/>
Without the sense of that which I forbore&mdash;<br/>
Thy touch upon the palm.&nbsp; The widest land<br/>
Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine<br/>
With pulses that beat double.&nbsp; What I do<br/>
And what I dream include thee, as the wine<br/>
Must taste of its own grapes.&nbsp; And when I sue<br/>
God for myself, He hears that name of thine,<br/>
And sees within my eyes the tears of two.</p>
