<h2>XXVII</h2>
<p class="poetry">My own Belov&euml;d, who hast lifted me<br />
From this drear flat of earth where I was thrown,<br />
And, in betwixt the languid ringlets, blown<br />
A life-breath, till the forehead hopefully<br />
Shines out again, as all the angels see,<br />
Before thy saving kiss!&nbsp; My own, my own,<br />
Who camest to me when the world was gone,<br />
And I who looked for only God, found thee!<br />
I find thee; I am safe, and strong, and glad.<br />
As one who stands in dewless asphodel,<br />
Looks backward on the tedious time he had<br />
In the upper life,&mdash;so I, with bosom-swell,<br />
Make witness, here, between the good and bad,<br />
That Love, as strong as Death, retrieves as well.</p>
