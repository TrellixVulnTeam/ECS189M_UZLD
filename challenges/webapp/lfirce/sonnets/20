<p class="poetry">Belov&euml;d, my Belov&euml;d, when I think<br
/>
That thou wast in the world a year ago,<br />
What time I sat alone here in the snow<br />
And saw no footprint, heard the silence sink<br />
No moment at thy voice, but, link by link,<br />
Went counting all my chains as if that so<br />
They never could fall off at any blow<br />
Struck by thy possible hand,&mdash;why, thus I drink<br />
Of life&rsquo;s great cup of wonder!&nbsp; Wonderful,<br />
Never to feel thee thrill the day or night<br />
With personal act or speech,&mdash;nor ever cull<br />
Some prescience of thee with the blossoms white<br />
Thou sawest growing!&nbsp; Atheists are as dull,<br />
Who cannot guess God&rsquo;s presence out of sight.</p>
