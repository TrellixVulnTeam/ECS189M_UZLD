<h4>XXVI</h4>
<p class="poetry">I lived with visions for my company
Instead of men and women, years ago,
And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know
A sweeter music than they played to me.
But soon their trailing purple was not free
Of this world&rsquo;s dust, their lutes did silent grow,
And I myself grew faint and blind below
Their vanishing eyes.&nbsp; Then thou didst come&mdash;to be,

Belov&euml;d, what they seemed.&nbsp; Their shining fronts,
Their songs, their splendours, (better, yet the same,
As river-water hallowed into fonts)
Met in thee, and from out thee overcame
My soul with satisfaction of all wants:
Because God&rsquo;s gifts put man&rsquo;s best dreams to
shame.</p>
