<h4>XXVI</h4>
<p class="poetry">I lived with visions for my company<br />
Instead of men and women, years ago,<br />
And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know<br />
A sweeter music than they played to me.<br />
But soon their trailing purple was not free<br />
Of this world&rsquo;s dust, their lutes did silent grow,<br />
And I myself grew faint and blind below<br />
Their vanishing eyes.&nbsp; Then thou didst come&mdash;to be,<br
/>
Belov&euml;d, what they seemed.&nbsp; Their shining fronts,<br />
Their songs, their splendours, (better, yet the same,<br />
As river-water hallowed into fonts)<br />
Met in thee, and from out thee overcame<br />
My soul with satisfaction of all wants:<br />
Because God&rsquo;s gifts put man&rsquo;s best dreams to
shame.</p>
