<h2>XXVIII</h2>
<p class="poetry">My letters! all dead paper, mute and white!<br
/>
And yet they seem alive and quivering<br />
Against my tremulous hands which loose the string<br />
And let them drop down on my knee to-night.<br />
This said,&mdash;he wished to have me in his sight<br />
Once, as a friend: this fixed a day in spring<br />
To come and touch my hand . . . a simple thing,<br />
Yet I wept for it!&mdash;this, . . . the paper&rsquo;s light . .
.<br />
Said, Dear I love thee; and I sank and quailed<br />
As if God&rsquo;s future thundered on my past.<br />
This said, I am thine&mdash;and so its ink has paled<br />
With lying at my heart that beat too fast.<br />
And this . . . O Love, thy words have ill availed<br />
If, what this said, I dared repeat at last!</p>
