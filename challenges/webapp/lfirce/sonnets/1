<h2>I</h2>
<p class="poetry">I thought once how Theocritus had sung<br />
Of the sweet years, the dear and wished-for years,<br />
Who each one in a gracious hand appears<br />
To bear a gift for mortals, old or young:<br />
And, as I mused it in his antique tongue,<br />
I saw, in gradual vision through my tears,<br />
The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,<br />
Those of my own life, who by turns had flung<br />
A shadow across me.&nbsp; Straightway I was &rsquo;ware,<br />
So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move<br />
Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair;<br />
And a voice said in mastery, while I strove,&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Guess now who holds
thee!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Death,&rdquo; I said, But, there,<br />
The silver answer rang, &ldquo;Not Death, but Love.&rdquo;</p>
