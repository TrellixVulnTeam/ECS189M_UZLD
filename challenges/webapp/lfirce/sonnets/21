<p class="poetry">Say over again, and yet once over again,<br />
That thou dost love me.&nbsp; Though the word repeated<br />
Should seem a &ldquo;cuckoo-song,&rdquo; as thou dost treat
it,<br />
Remember, never to the hill or plain,<br />
Valley and wood, without her cuckoo-strain<br />
Comes the fresh Spring in all her green completed.<br />
Belov&euml;d, I, amid the darkness greeted<br />
By a doubtful spirit-voice, in that doubt&rsquo;s pain<br />
Cry, &ldquo;Speak once more&mdash;thou lovest!&rdquo;&nbsp; Who
can fear<br />
Too many stars, though each in heaven shall roll,<br />
Too many flowers, though each shall crown the year?<br />
Say thou dost love me, love me, love me&mdash;toll<br />
The silver iterance!&mdash;only minding, Dear,<br />
To love me also in silence with thy soul.</p>
