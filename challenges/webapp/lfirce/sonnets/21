<h4>XXI</h4>
<p class="poetry">Say over again, and yet once over again,
That thou dost love me.&nbsp; Though the word repeated
Should seem a &ldquo;cuckoo-song,&rdquo; as thou dost treat
it,
Remember, never to the hill or plain,
Valley and wood, without her cuckoo-strain
Comes the fresh Spring in all her green completed.
Belov&euml;d, I, amid the darkness greeted
By a doubtful spirit-voice, in that doubt&rsquo;s pain
Cry, &ldquo;Speak once more&mdash;thou lovest!&rdquo;&nbsp; Who
can fear
Too many stars, though each in heaven shall roll,
Too many flowers, though each shall crown the year?
Say thou dost love me, love me, love me&mdash;toll
The silver iterance!&mdash;only minding, Dear,
To love me also in silence with thy soul.</p>
