<h4>XIX</h4>
<p class="poetry">The soul&rsquo;s Rialto hath its
merchandize;
I barter curl for curl upon that mart,
And from my poet&rsquo;s forehead to my heart
Receive this lock which outweighs argosies,&mdash;
As purply black, as erst to Pindar&rsquo;s eyes
The dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart
The nine white Muse-brows.&nbsp; For this counterpart, . . .

The bay crown&rsquo;s shade, Belov&euml;d, I surmise,
Still lingers on thy curl, it is so black!
Thus, with a fillet of smooth-kissing breath,
I tie the shadows safe from gliding back,
And lay the gift where nothing hindereth;
Here on my heart, as on thy brow, to lack
No natural heat till mine grows cold in death.</p>
