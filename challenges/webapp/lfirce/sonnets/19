<p class="poetry">The soul&rsquo;s Rialto hath its
merchandize;<br />
I barter curl for curl upon that mart,<br />
And from my poet&rsquo;s forehead to my heart<br />
Receive this lock which outweighs argosies,&mdash;<br />
As purply black, as erst to Pindar&rsquo;s eyes<br />
The dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart<br />
The nine white Muse-brows.&nbsp; For this counterpart, . . .<br
/>
The bay crown&rsquo;s shade, Belov&euml;d, I surmise,<br />
Still lingers on thy curl, it is so black!<br />
Thus, with a fillet of smooth-kissing breath,<br />
I tie the shadows safe from gliding back,<br />
And lay the gift where nothing hindereth;<br />
Here on my heart, as on thy brow, to lack<br />
No natural heat till mine grows cold in death.</p>
