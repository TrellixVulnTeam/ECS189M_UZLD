<p class="poetry">Can it be right to give what I can give?<br />
To let thee sit beneath the fall of tears<br />
As salt as mine, and hear the sighing years<br />
Re-sighing on my lips renunciative<br />
Through those infrequent smiles which fail to live<br />
For all thy adjurations?&nbsp; O my fears,<br />
That this can scarce be right!&nbsp; We are not peers<br />
So to be lovers; and I own, and grieve,<br />
That givers of such gifts as mine are, must<br />
Be counted with the ungenerous.&nbsp; Out, alas!<br />
I will not soil thy purple with my dust,<br />
Nor breathe my poison on thy Venice-glass,<br />
Nor give thee any love&mdash;which were unjust.<br />
Beloved, I only love thee! let it pass.</p>
