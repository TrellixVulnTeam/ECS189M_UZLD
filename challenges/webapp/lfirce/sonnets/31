<h4>XXXI</h4>
<p class="poetry">Thou comest! all is said without a word.<br />
I sit beneath thy looks, as children do<br />
In the noon-sun, with souls that tremble through<br />
Their happy eyelids from an unaverred<br />
Yet prodigal inward joy.&nbsp; Behold, I erred<br />
In that last doubt! and yet I cannot rue<br />
The sin most, but the occasion&mdash;that we two<br />
Should for a moment stand unministered<br />
By a mutual presence.&nbsp; Ah, keep near and close,<br />
Thou dove-like help! and when my fears would rise,<br />
With thy broad heart serenely interpose:<br />
Brood down with thy divine sufficiencies<br />
These thoughts which tremble when bereft of those,<br />
Like callow birds left desert to the skies.</p>
