<h4>XXXIX</h4>
<p class="poetry">Because thou hast the power and own&rsquo;st
the grace<br />
To look through and behind this mask of me,<br />
(Against which, years have beat thus blanchingly,<br />
With their rains,) and behold my soul&rsquo;s true face,<br />
The dim and weary witness of life&rsquo;s race,&mdash;<br />
Because thou hast the faith and love to see,<br />
Through that same soul&rsquo;s distracting lethargy,<br />
The patient angel waiting for a place<br />
In the new Heavens,&mdash;because nor sin nor woe,<br />
Nor God&rsquo;s infliction, nor death&rsquo;s neighbourhood,<br
/>
Nor all which others viewing, turn to go,<br />
Nor all which makes me tired of all, self-viewed,&mdash;<br />
Nothing repels thee, . . . Dearest, teach me so<br />
To pour out gratitude, as thou dost, good!</p>
