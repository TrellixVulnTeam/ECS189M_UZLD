<h4>XXXIX</h4>
<p class="poetry">Because thou hast the power and own&rsquo;st
the grace
To look through and behind this mask of me,
(Against which, years have beat thus blanchingly,
With their rains,) and behold my soul&rsquo;s true face,
The dim and weary witness of life&rsquo;s race,&mdash;
Because thou hast the faith and love to see,
Through that same soul&rsquo;s distracting lethargy,
The patient angel waiting for a place
In the new Heavens,&mdash;because nor sin nor woe,
Nor God&rsquo;s infliction, nor death&rsquo;s neighbourhood,

Nor all which others viewing, turn to go,
Nor all which makes me tired of all, self-viewed,&mdash;
Nothing repels thee, . . . Dearest, teach me so
To pour out gratitude, as thou dost, good!</p>
