<h4>XLIV</h4>
<p class="poetry">Belov&euml;d, thou hast brought me many
flowers<br />
Plucked in the garden, all the summer through,<br />
And winter, and it seemed as if they grew<br />
In this close room, nor missed the sun and showers.<br />
So, in the like name of that love of ours,<br />
Take back these thoughts which here unfolded too,<br />
And which on warm and cold days I withdrew<br />
From my heart&rsquo;s ground.&nbsp; Indeed, those beds and
bowers<br />
Be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue,<br />
And wait thy weeding; yet here&rsquo;s eglantine,<br />
Here&rsquo;s ivy!&mdash;take them, as I used to do<br />
Thy flowers, and keep them where they shall not pine.<br />
Instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true,<br />
And tell thy soul, their roots are left in mine.</p>
