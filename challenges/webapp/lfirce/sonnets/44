<h4>XLIV</h4>
<p class="poetry">Belov&euml;d, thou hast brought me many
flowers
Plucked in the garden, all the summer through,
And winter, and it seemed as if they grew
In this close room, nor missed the sun and showers.
So, in the like name of that love of ours,
Take back these thoughts which here unfolded too,
And which on warm and cold days I withdrew
From my heart&rsquo;s ground.&nbsp; Indeed, those beds and
bowers
Be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue,
And wait thy weeding; yet here&rsquo;s eglantine,
Here&rsquo;s ivy!&mdash;take them, as I used to do
Thy flowers, and keep them where they shall not pine.
Instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true,
And tell thy soul, their roots are left in mine.</p>
