<h2>XXXVI</h2>
<p class="poetry">When we met first and loved, I did not build<br
/>
Upon the event with marble.&nbsp; Could it mean<br />
To last, a love set pendulous between<br />
Sorrow and sorrow?&nbsp; Nay, I rather thrilled,<br />
Distrusting every light that seemed to gild<br />
The onward path, and feared to overlean<br />
A finger even.&nbsp; And, though I have grown serene<br />
And strong since then, I think that God has willed<br />
A still renewable fear . . . O love, O troth . . .<br />
Lest these enclasp&euml;d hands should never hold,<br />
This mutual kiss drop down between us both<br />
As an unowned thing, once the lips being cold.<br />
And Love, be false! if he, to keep one oath,<br />
Must lose one joy, by his life&rsquo;s star foretold.</p>
