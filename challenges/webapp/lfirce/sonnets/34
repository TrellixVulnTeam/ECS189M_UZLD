<h4>XXXIV</h4>
<p class="poetry">With the same heart, I said, I&rsquo;ll answer
thee<br />
As those, when thou shalt call me by my name&mdash;<br />
Lo, the vain promise! is the same, the same,<br />
Perplexed and ruffled by life&rsquo;s strategy?<br />
When called before, I told how hastily<br />
I dropped my flowers or brake off from a game.<br />
To run and answer with the smile that came<br />
At play last moment, and went on with me<br />
Through my obedience.&nbsp; When I answer now,<br />
I drop a grave thought, break from solitude;<br />
Yet still my heart goes to thee&mdash;ponder how&mdash;<br />
Not as to a single good, but all my good!<br />
Lay thy hand on it, best one, and allow<br />
That no child&rsquo;s foot could run fast as this blood.</p>
