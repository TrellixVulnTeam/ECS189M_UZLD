<h4>XXXIV</h4>
<p class="poetry">With the same heart, I said, I&rsquo;ll answer
thee
As those, when thou shalt call me by my name&mdash;
Lo, the vain promise! is the same, the same,
Perplexed and ruffled by life&rsquo;s strategy?
When called before, I told how hastily
I dropped my flowers or brake off from a game.
To run and answer with the smile that came
At play last moment, and went on with me
Through my obedience.&nbsp; When I answer now,
I drop a grave thought, break from solitude;
Yet still my heart goes to thee&mdash;ponder how&mdash;
Not as to a single good, but all my good!
Lay thy hand on it, best one, and allow
That no child&rsquo;s foot could run fast as this blood.</p>
