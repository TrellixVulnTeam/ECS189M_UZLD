<h2>XXXII</h2>
<p class="poetry">The first time that the sun rose on thine
oath<br />
To love me, I looked forward to the moon<br />
To slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon<br />
And quickly tied to make a lasting troth.<br />
Quick-loving hearts, I thought, may quickly loathe;<br />
And, looking on myself, I seemed not one<br />
For such man&rsquo;s love!&mdash;more like an out-of-tune<br />
Worn viol, a good singer would be wroth<br />
To spoil his song with, and which, snatched in haste,<br />
Is laid down at the first ill-sounding note.<br />
I did not wrong myself so, but I placed<br />
A wrong on thee.&nbsp; For perfect strains may float<br />
&rsquo;Neath master-hands, from instruments defaced,&mdash;<br />
And great souls, at one stroke, may do and doat.</p>
