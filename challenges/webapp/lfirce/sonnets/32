<h4>XXXII</h4>
<p class="poetry">The first time that the sun rose on thine
oath
To love me, I looked forward to the moon
To slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon
And quickly tied to make a lasting troth.
Quick-loving hearts, I thought, may quickly loathe;
And, looking on myself, I seemed not one
For such man&rsquo;s love!&mdash;more like an out-of-tune
Worn viol, a good singer would be wroth
To spoil his song with, and which, snatched in haste,
Is laid down at the first ill-sounding note.
I did not wrong myself so, but I placed
A wrong on thee.&nbsp; For perfect strains may float
&rsquo;Neath master-hands, from instruments defaced,&mdash;
And great souls, at one stroke, may do and doat.</p>
